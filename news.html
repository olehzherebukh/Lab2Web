            <h3>New Concert is approaching!</h3>
            <p>Scorpions brought Bloodstock Open Air 2019 to an emphatic close on Sunday night (11th August) with a triumphant career-spanning set.
               Their only UK show of the year – and first gig on these shores since they headlined Stone Free Festival in June 2018 –
                the German hard rock icons treated the Catton Park faithful to an epic set that opened with 2015 track ‘Going Out with a Bang’ and culminated with their timeless classic ‘Rock You Like a Hurricane’.</p>
